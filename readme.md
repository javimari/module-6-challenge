# Module 6 - Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. This is a user-friendly web application that provides current and future weather outlook for cities worldwide, allowing travelers to plan their trips according to the weather conditions.
